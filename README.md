DESCRIPTION:
Introduction

The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset frequently used for data analytics and machine learning. It provides information about the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including details such as age, sex, ticket class, and whether they survived the sinking. This dataset is ideal for exploring various data analysis techniques, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), which helps us understand the data's structure, clean it and uncover underlying patterns.

By completing this Task of EDA on Titanic Dataset, the following are the objectives that I have achieved: 

1. Understanding the Data: I have gained a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's structure, variables, and types of data.
2. Data Cleaning: I have identified and handled missing values.
3. Data Visualization: I have used visualizations to explore relationships between variables, distributions, and patterns in the data.
4. Summary Statistics: I have generated descriptive statistics to summarize the central tendency, dispersion and shape of the dataset's distribution.
5. Correlation Analysis: I have identified correlations between numerical features to understand how they relate to each other.

The following are the steps that I have followed for doing the Task:

1. Loading the Data:
   - I have loaded the Titanic dataset using pandas.
   - Then, the first few rows were displayed to understand the structure of the dataset.

2. Summary Statistics:
   - I used the summary statistics to generate and understand the central tendency and dispersion of the numerical features.
   - The ‘describe()’ function provided a summary of the numerical columns, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values.

3. Checking for Missing Values:
   - I have identified columns with missing values to decide on strategies for handling them.
   - The ‘isnull().sum()’ function counts the number of missing values in each column, helping to identify columns that need cleaning.

4. Data Visualization:
   - I have visualized the distributions and relationships between variables using histograms, box plots, and a correlation heatmap.

   a. Histograms:
   - To visualize the distribution of numerical features.
   - Histograms have been generated for all numerical features to visualize their distributions.

   b. Box Plots for Numerical Features:
  - I have used box plots to identify outliers and understand the spread of numerical features.
  - Box plots have been generated for each numerical feature to visualize their spread and detect outliers.

   c. Correlation Heatmap:
   - Compute and visualize the correlation matrix to identify relationships between numerical variables.
   - The correlation matrix was computed for numerical features and visualized using a heatmap to identify significant correlations between variables.

CONCLUSION:

Through this EDA process on Titanic Dataset, I was able to:
- Load and inspect the Titanic dataset.
- Generate summary statistics to understand the central tendency and dispersion of the data.
- Identify missing values to inform data cleaning strategies.
- Visualize distributions and relationships using histograms, box plots and a correlation heatmap.

I think these steps have provided a solid foundation for further data cleaning, feature engineering and predictive modeling, which could ensure that the dataset is well-understood and ready for machine learning algorithms.
